# Colour Grabber:  

This is a small project that I made for use with image editing software, it allows you to pull colours  
from anywhere on your screen. I found this far more convenient than creating screenshots and then opening  
them in Photoshop just to get a single colour value. It can open images and display them for colour  
grabbing and can also save the palettes that you create in config files for later use.

### Prerequisites:  

* Windows 7 or higher
* Java  

### How to run the program:  

Simply run the .exe file located in the git repository.
